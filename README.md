## Problems our product solves

1. Identity Representation

   - The application enables users to express their unique identity through their NFT holdings rather than relying on traditional profile information.

2. NFT Discovery
   - The application provides a platform for users to discover and connect with others who share similar interests and NFT holdings.

3. Community Building
   - By facilitating connections between users based on NFT holdings, the application supports the growth and development of the web3 community. The app addresses a long-standing demand for NFT "swippable" applications in the web3 space.
